This was a project I was assigned to work on for my Machine Learning 
class in college. This assignment involves using various search algorithms 
in order to help PacMan trace through a maze to find the pellet. In order to 
run it, you can use the following syntax:

python pacman.py -l [name of maze] -p [agent] -a fn=[algorithm],heuristic=[type]

EXAMPLE: python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs

This project was adapted from a UCBerkeley project. Full documentation can be
found here: http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html

My apologies for the lengthy description!
